# Python-Mini-Projects
# Bill Splitter
It calculates and fairly distributes the total bill among workers, considering edge cases like single participants or disproportionate splitting.
Perfect for group events, roommates, or team lunches.
# concept:
Conditional statements (if, elif), Arithmetic operations, Functions and rounding, Input handling
# BMI Calculator
It helps determine whether your body weight is healthy based on height (in feet) and weight (in kg), categorizing results from underweight to obese.
# concept:
Mathematical formula application, Functions and unit conversion, Conditional logic
# Dice Rolling Simulator
Two players roll virtual dice, and the one with the higher total wins — a quick demo of randomization and simple game logic.
# concept:
random.randint() for dice rolls, Loops (for) and list operations, Functions and user input
# Guess the Number
The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user keeps guessing until they get it right or choose to quit.
# concept:
Infinite while loop, random.randint() for target number, User input and type casting, Conditional comparison
# Lucky Draw
In this the participants where guess a number and might win a prize like gold, silver, or cash if it matches the lucky number.
# concept:
random.randint() and random.choice(), Loops and conditional logic
# Phonebook Application
It is used to supports full CRUD operations — add, delete, search, and display contacts interactively.
An ideal beginner project to practice dictionary manipulation and user input handling.
# concept:
Dictionary data structure, Loops (while), Conditional and nested logic, String & key handling
# Random Password Generator
Random Password Generator is used to generate random password that builds complex, secure passwords using letters, digits, and special characters.
# concept:
random.choice() from string library, Loops for character selection, String concatenation
# Student Performance Analysis
This project calculates key metrics like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation — and identifies the top performer based on average marks.
# concept:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data analysis using pandas, Statistical functions from statistics, Class & method creation
